This application will aim at helping its users by converting the units from one another. This app will take input from the user and convert it to the desired unit and give the result. For example, it will be able to convert a value in centimeters to Meters or grams to kilograms and vice versa. To develop this application, Android Studio is required. The knowledge of XML would be required for the user interface and the Java programming for the application's conversion functionality.
